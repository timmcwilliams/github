      <p id="main-bio">Houston Native - 1 daughter, 1 son, 1 Grandson, Adopted son that was 7 and is now 10. Always worked in the oilfield specific to chemicals. Worked at one company for 20 years and then moved because thougth it was a good idea to do something else. 
      <br>
      Since then have joined 2 other chemical companies and built and started another chemco using a public companies money (that was fun). Since all that my career has turned a bit - running a chemical trading company that is online based "GoChem.co" (not ".com"). Now own a Kona Ice Food Truck business, raising the kids, helping the community rebuild after the storm and playing golf and flying airplanes. 
      BTW - Still play guitar, hunt and fish and work at other "hobbies". 
      <br>
      Looking forward to using this skillset to use applications to assist and create value added segment to companies and mine and my families lives. </p>
